# CORA Axioms v0.1

CORA is defined by exactly three axioms:

---

## **Axiom 1 — Capability is the Only Authority**

All authority in the runtime is represented solely by capabilities.  
If no capability is held, no authority exists.

---

## **Axiom 2 — All Interaction Occurs Only via Message Passing**

Objects may affect one another only through explicit message passing.  
If no message is sent, no interaction occurs.

---

## **Axiom 3 — Capabilities Transfer Only by Explicit Message**

A capability may change holders only when explicitly included in a message.  
If not explicitly transferred, it never moves.

---

These three axioms form the complete foundation of CORA.
